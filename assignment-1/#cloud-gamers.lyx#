Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is a feasibility study on the subject of whether or not a cloud computing
 environment would be suitable for an international team of video game developer
s.
 This study fulfills the requirement in Assignment 1, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

We are a group of video game developers from several countries.
 Evaluate if it would make sense for us to use cloud computing to build
 games.

 we mean the term as defiined in

\end_inset

.
 In this work we assume Amazon Web Services is our cloud services provider.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For this evauluation we determine the scope of activities that should be
 done in the cloud.
 We consider whether or not it would be appropriate for 
\shape italic
all
\shape default
 activities to be done on a cloud based platform, or some of them.
 Pertinent to this consideration is the cost of activities.
 We use pricing data to bolster our recommendations.
 We discuss which activities could be done in the cloud.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Part*
Scope of Activities in the Cloud
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
One Hundred Percent In the Cloud?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first thought we had for doing this evaluation was that we are proposing
 to have developers write, compile, and exectute code on virtual machines
 on a platform like Amazon Web Services as part of the game development
 process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
This would be unneccessary and wasteful.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
It is not necessary...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is not necessary for developers to do all of their work on virtual machines
 because they have to use some kind of device to access internet based services
 in the first place.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We feel that activities that require high utilization of system resources
 should be carried out on physical machines that are within a few meters
 of the developer.
 This would include compiling source code, running unit tests, and hand
 testing larger units of execution.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Personal experience has shown the writer that these kinds of resource intensive
 tasks are more conveniently performed on systems physically close by, espeicall
y when the need for troubleshooting arises.
 When programming a remote system, there is a temptation to blame network
 latency for poor performance.
 One's ego can blind one to the fact of the inferiority of his creations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since developers have to have some sort of machine to participate in development
 projects, the most resource intensive activities should be done locally.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
It would be wasteful...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two resources that would be wasted: money and bandwidth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Wasting Bandwidth
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We are discussing video game development.
 We point this out to underscore the key word video.
 In general we must allow for the amount of data involved in creating, recording
, transmitting, displaying video to be large.
 This is an inescapble consequence of the fact that a good digital video
 is a series of digital images, a quality digital image is a collection
 of millions of pixels, where we need three bytes of storage for every pixel
 if we want to get a realistic palette of colors.
 If developers are working on video in a way that requires the video to
 be sent from a remote location for every iteration of their work, then
 large amounts of data are getting dowloaded unecessarily due to the data-intens
ive nature of video.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We are aware of compression techniques that do a wonderful job of reducing
 the size of digital video.
 However, during the initial phases of development for a new game, developers
 reasonably would not want any unnecessary factors impinging on the quality
 of their work.
 This enables developers to choose the compression scheme that best suits
 their work when the work is more mature.
 This is another reason we would not want developers doing video-related
 work on remote systems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The bottom line is that sending video over the internet potentially means
 sending large amounts of data over the internet.
 We should avoid sending more video over the network than necessary as a
 way to allocate more of network resources to activities where using the
 network absolutely necessary.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Wasting Money
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section we look at the cost of a resonably powerful workstation
 suitable for video game development and compare that to the cost of using
 an equivalent machine available from Amazon Web Services.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We are assuming here that our team of developers is working on PC games.
 Presently, we are not aware of cloud based offerings of specialized systems
 such as video game console development kits.
 The cloud based virtual machine offerings that we know of are alternatives
 to using PC's.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a game development system, it makes sense to use a system for playing
 video games.
 So, we choose a high-end Alienware system from Dell, with a 24 inch monitor.
 The price of this system on Dell.com at the time of this writing is $2,597.99
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-39"

\end_inset

.
 We are considering an international team of developers, so we will add
 another $200.00 for shipping.
 Also, debugging graphical applications often requires a separate monitor
 because user interface actions, such as key presses and mouse clicks a
 developer would need to do to switch to an IDE window while the game is
 active can disrupt the debugging process.
 So, we add a second 24 inch monitor to the list of equipment our developer
 will need.
 Priceline.com lists several at various prices, we will assume purchase of
 a monitor plus shipping will come out to $300.00.
 This gives us an estimated cost of $3,097.99 for the equipment we would
 need to provide to a programmer for his video game development work.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Dell web site lists the following metrics for components that we will
 need for determining which instance to select from AWS to get an eqivalent
 machine: 16 GB random access memory, 2 TB hard drive, 4 core Intel i7 processor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We use 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-41"

\end_inset

 to find a price for the equivalent system.
 The closest equivalent we find is the m3.Xlarge instance.
 The AWS FAQ recommends fixed performance instances for resource intensive
 applications 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-42"

\end_inset

.
 It has 4 vCPU's, 15 GB random access memory, and 80 GB storage.
 This is far less storage than the Dell machine we are considering.
 We could factor in the cost of using S-3 storage to get an equivalent amount
 of storage space for the Amazon m3.Xlarge instance, but we will ignore that
 cost for the purposes of this estimate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amazon prices usage of the instance at $0.28 per hour.
 We will assume that the instance must remain on constantly to accomodate
 developer's inspiration that could occur at any time.
 The cost of leaving the instance running for one year (
\begin_inset Formula $\$0.28\times24\times365$
\end_inset

) is $2,452.80.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Surprisingly, this is very close to the cost of the Dell Alienware Aurora
 - $3,097.99.
 However, we can reasonably amortize the cost of the Aurora over two years.
 Thus, the annual cost for using the Aurora is approximately $1549.0.
 We therefore realize a savings of $903.80 anually if we field the developer
 the Dell Alienware Aurora as opposed to the m3.Xlarge AWS instance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus we have shown that we can field developers high end systems and save
 approximately 30% of the cost of fielding an equivalent virtual machine
 running on a cloud based platform.
 The virtual machine dedicated to the write, compile, test development cycle
 that is a large part of a developer's work is a waste of money in consideration
 of what we have discussed above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
What We Should Use the Cloud For
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have gone to some lengths to show that relying entirely on the cloud
 is not cost effective in terms of money or bandwidth.
 However there are many use cases where relying on the cloud makes sense.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Batch Processing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is conceivable that a video game development project would need to do
 some highly parallel, compute intensive jobs, such as using raytracing
 to render images.
 There are many interesting approaches to do these kinds of projects, but
 to delve into them in detail is outside the scope of this essay.
 One solution is to use Amazon's Elastic Map Reduce offering to do this
 kind of batch processing 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-60"

\end_inset

.
 However, we realized it is not cheap - we ran a six-node hadoop cluster
 on EMR a few months ago and quickly realized the bill was going to be on
 the order of hundreds of dollars if we left the cluster running - so we
 shut it off.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the same time, it is definitely more cost-effective and space-effective
 to rent a cluster of say, 100 virtual machines from Amazon for an hour
 to do a highly parallel computation than it would be to purchase 100 Dell
 Alienware Aurora PC's to do the same computation, let alone find the space
 to put them all where we could get enough electricity to even turn them
 all on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are some special cases where computation is best done in the cloud,
 batch processing that one can use Hadoop for is an example.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Getting started
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we are just starting up the international team, we need to use the cloud.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For this use case, we are thinking of using the cloud at the software-as-a-servi
ce (SAAS) level.
 Two example services that come to mind are linkedin.com and odesk.com.
 If we are looking to assemble a team of developers from around the world
 we need to use services like these to locate, interview and select our
 team members.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Linkedin.com is a well known business oriented social networking that claims
 to have over 300 million users
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-44"

\end_inset

.
 Someone looking to assemble a team of programmers can use linkedin to post
 employment opportunities and search for candidates.
 Linkedin.com is only one example of software-as-a-service platforms one
 can take advantage of to assemble a geographically dispersed team of video
 game developers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Odesk.com is a site oriented to connecting freelance software developers
 with customers in need of new software
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-45"

\end_inset

.
 One strategy for assembling a team is to write project specifications in
 a modular fashion and hire developers on medium to long term contracts
 to implement different modules of the specification.
 Services such as the one Odesk.com provides are a convenient way to hire
 developers where the work to be done and cost for the work is negociated
 up-front.
 For some video game development teams and project goals, using a cloud
 service like Odesk.com might be as far as the team leader would need to
 go to assemble a team to accomplish the goals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even if we are planning on a world tour to seek out the greatest programmers
 in all the technology hot-spots we would be remiss in our search if we
 did not include some of the business oriented social networking services
 that are so widely and cheaply available.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Getting together
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the team is already assembled, there are more services we could use at
 the software-as-a-service level for communicating.
 Person to person and group communications is an example of a use case where
 we would want to send video over the network, as opposed to doing game
 development as we discussed above.
 In this case, we would be willing to use bandwidth for video communications.
 Personal experience shows that tense discussions about common topics in
 software development, such as design approaches, can be diffused with voice
 or face to face communications.
 At times exchanging written communications only results in frustration
 for all parties involved.
 Security and privacy concerns drive what we decide to use for communicating.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
If privacy and security is not a concern:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we do not care who is listening in to our conversations we can use any
 free, software-as-a-service communications applications that are in such
 wonderful abundance in this day and age.
 Examples are Skype
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-46"

\end_inset

, and the Google Hangouts Plugin.
 These are only two among dozens of possible applications one may use to
 communicate far more cheaply than with traditional telephony.
 If the video game project we are working on is a team of volunteers working
 on a free, open source project where privacy and secrecy is not a concern,
 then options abound.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The caveat to using these services is that one must often agree to terms
 of service that stipulate that the service provider is allowed to collect
 data one stores in their cloud for further use.
 The Google Privacy Policy states, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We provide personal information to our affiliates or other trusted businesses
 or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance
 with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security
 measures.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-48"

\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 So, not only is Google admitting they will collect data from its users,
 but also they are stating that they provide it to third parties.
 Suffice it to say, popular free-to-use, software-as-a-service communciations
 applications are not private, and are probably not the best choice for
 exchanging information like trade secrets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Secure Communications in the Cloud
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One might be tempted to make the assumption that a paid, cloud based communicati
ons service would be secure.
 Some investigation shows that a cloud provided virtual machine to host
 communications may be the only way to have a guarantee of security.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We did some research into providers to find an example of a paid, video
 conferencing service, 1Click.
 This is from their privacy policy, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally
 identifiable information.
 This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating
 our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those
 parties agree to keep this information confidential.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 So, while somewhat reassuring, we are not receiving a guarantee that 1Click
 is not going to share some of our data with others in their privacy policy.
 If we want to be sure that information about our conversations is not going
 to be leaked, we can install our own communications server on a cloud provided
 virtual machine, such as an AWS instance.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We found two examples of communications server software one could install
 on an AWS instance to provide a team of developers a way to communicate.
 The first example is a free, as in available at no cost, open source server.
 We have not evaluated this software and we are not recommending it.
 We are merely providing it as an example.
 The software is called red5chat.
 The source code is available for download on SourceForge.com
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-50"

\end_inset

.
 In theory, one could install this software on an AWS instance and provide
 users a way to communicate using video.
 If the users are connecting to the instance over a VPN, then the communcations
 are reasonably secure, and we can be sure the service provider is not disclsing
 our communciations data to third parties, because we are the provider.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we are inclined to spend some money on a communications solution, we
 have an example of another way of taking the same approach of installing
 our own communications software.
 Cisco Jabber
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-51"

\end_inset

 is an example of a paid server solution.
 We see in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-51"

\end_inset

 a link to request a price for the software.
 This usually means the price is high, and the vendor is trying to ascertain
 the maximum amount the potential customer is willing to pay before providing
 a quote.
 However, the same web page lists features that indicates Jabber integrates
 well with other software and provides the features professionals expect
 when collaborating.
 At the same time, a quick look over the installation guide 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-52"

\end_inset

indicates that setting up a Jabber server is an involved process.
 This illustrates a good point about the trade off in using the cloud for
 secure communications: the more security we require, the more involved
 we have to be in maintaining the infrastructure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Software Development
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Project management Systems
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Until now, we have danced around the primary purpose of what an international
 team of video game developers: to write code!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While we made the case that frequent development tasks such as compiling
 and testing source code should not be done entirely in the cloud, there
 there are some aspects of the software development process that we absoultely
 recommend using the cloud for.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In my personal experience, software development teams use a workflow management
 system to collaborate on projects.
 Examples are Jira
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-53"

\end_inset

 (paid), and Apache Bloodhound 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-54"

\end_inset

(free).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It makes sense to host the software we use to collaborate on projects in
 the cloud because it is centrally located.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The information in such a system can be highly sensitive.
 Here is where developers are collaborating on design and implementation.
 If the team is not welcoming public participation in the project then we
 desire a high level of security.
 Installing one of these collaboration systems in an AWS instance that is
 accessed in a secure fashion is one way to protect our developers' collaboratio
n.
 It also enables us to maintain ownership of the data in the collaboration
 management system, but make it highly available at the same time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Version Control / Source Code Repositories
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Version control is an indispensible tool for the software development process.
 A discussion of the benefits of using version control is outside the scope
 of this essay, however we found a discussion in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-56"

\end_inset

 that is informative for any curious readers.
 Development teams that want to create open source projects have many free
 options, such as GitHub
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-55"

\end_inset

, or Google Code.
 However just as is the case with communications, the code under version
 control these services provide is not stored in a secure manner.
 In fact, GitHub explictly states that the projects I create with it are
 publicly available, and that I am free to pay to make my repositories private
 if I am so inclined.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the remainder of this section we will assume that the team of international
 software developers is working on a commercial project where the software
 is valuable intellectual property.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Version control software, as a source code repository can be highly sensitive,
 perhaps even more so than the data in project management systems described
 above.
 In fact, project management systems often integrate with version control,
 so that changes can be linked to projects for tasks such as code reviews.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the one hand, a central repository for software for developers to use
 to manage changes to source code is something we should not do without.
 So it makes sense to host the version control software in the cloud, because
 it needs to be available to a team of programmers scattered over the globe.
 Source code is often the most valuable.
 It is critical to protect, and not to be leaked to competitiors.
 We feel a good solution is like what we have described above, install the
 version control software on a cloud provided virtual machine and allow
 access in a secure fashion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In our personal experience, setting up a version control service (Subversion
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-59"

\end_inset

 in our case) in Linux is not over complicated and can be accomplished in
 about one hour.
 We recommend our international team of software developers use a secured
 cloud based server to host their version control.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The collaborative nature of version control systems means they should be
 hosted on line, available over the internet.
 However in the case of proprietary software, the possibly highly sensitive
 nature of what the version control system contains - it essentially stores
 the product we plan to sell - means the version contorl system should be
 secured.
 Installing and maintaining our own version control system on a cloud based
 virtual machine is a good way to balance these concerns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this essay we have discussed what an international team of video gamedevelope
rs should use the cloud for, and what they should not use the cloud for.
 A team of video game developers should probably not use the cloud for the
 most frequent tasks of writing and testing, and debugging source code.
 However, it could makes sense for developers to use the cloud for some
 forms of computation.
 Short running, highly parallel batch jobs are an example.
 It also makes a great deal of sense to use the cloud for software used
 in collaboration.
 There are freely available services we can use to collaborate on projects
 if we are not concerned about protecting intellectual property.
 There are paid services we can use if we are willing to trust providers.
 We can install and maintain our own collaborative software services on
 cloud based machines if we cannot afford to trust providers.
 It makes sense for the international game development team to use the cloud,
 for the colloaborative aspects of their work.
