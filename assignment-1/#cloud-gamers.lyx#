Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is a feasibility study on the subject of whether or not a cloud computing
 environment would be suitable for an international team of video game developer
s.
 This study fulfills the requirement in Assignment 1,

We are a group of video game developers from several countries.
 Evaluate if it would make sense for us to use cloud computing to build
 games.

\begin_layout Part*
One Hundred Percent In the Cloud?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first thought we had for doing this evaluation was that we are proposing
 to have developers write, compile, and exectute code on virtual machines
 on a platform like Amazon Web Services as part of the game development
 process.

\series bold
This would be unneccessary and wasteful.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
It is not necessary...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is not necessary for developers to do all of their work on virtual machines
 because they have to use some kind of device to access internet based services
 in the first place.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We feel that activities that require high utilization of system resources
 should be carried out on physical machines that are within a few meters
 of the developer.
 This would include compiling source code, running unit tests, and hand
 testing larger units of execution.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Personal experience has shown the writer that these kinds of resource intensive
 tasks are more conveniently performed on systems physically close by, espeicall
y when the need for troubleshooting arises.
 When programming a remote system, there is a temptation to blame network
 latency for poor performance.
 One's ego can blind one to the fact of the inferiority of his creations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since developers have to have some sort of machine to participate in development
 projects, the most resource intensive activities should be done locally.

It would be wasteful...
