\begin_layout Part*
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is a feasibility study on the subject of whether or not a cloud computing
 environment would be suitable for an international team of video game developer
s.
 This study fulfills the requirement in Assignment 1, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We are a group of video game developers from several countries.
 Evaluate if it would make sense for us to use cloud computing to build
 games.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For this evauluation we determine the scope of activities that should be
 done in the cloud.
 We consider whether or not it would be appropriate for 
\shape italic
all
\shape default
 activities to be done on a cloud based platform, or some of them.
 Pertinent to this consideration is the cost of activities.
 We use pricing data to bolster our recommendations.
 We discuss which activities could be done in the cloud.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Part*
Scope of Activities in the Cloud
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
One Hundred Percent In the Cloud?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first thought we had for doing this evaluation was that we are proposing
 to have developers write, compile, and exectute code on virtual machines
 on a platform like Amazon Web Services as part of the game development
 process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
This would be unneccessary and wasteful.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
It is not necessary...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is not necessary for developers to do all of their work on virtual machines
 because they have to use some kind of device to access internet based services
 in the first place.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We feel that activities that require high utilization of system resources
 should be carried out on physical machines that are within a few meters
 of the developer.
 This would include compiling source code, running unit tests, and hand
 testing larger units of execution.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Personal experience has shown the writer that these kinds of resource intensive
 tasks are more conveniently performed on systems physically close by, espeicall
y when the need for troubleshooting arises.
 When programming a remote system, there is a temptation to blame network
 latency for poor performance.
 One's ego can blind one to the fact of the inferiority of his creations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since developers have to have some sort of machine to participate in development
 projects, the most resource intensive activities should be done locally.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
It would be wasteful...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two resources that would be wasted: money and bandwidth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Wasting Bandwidth
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We are discussing video game development.
 We point this out to underscore the key word video.
 In general we must allow for the amount of data involved in creating, recording
, transmitting, displaying video to be large.
 This is an inescapble consequence of the fact that a good digital video
 is a series of digital images, a quality digital image is a collection
 of millions of pixels, where we need three bytes of storage for every pixel
 if we want to get a realistic palette of colors.
 If developers are working on video in a way that requires the video to
 be sent from a remote location for every iteration of their work, then
 large amounts of data are getting dowloaded unecessarily due to the data-intens
ive nature of video.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We are aware of compression techniques that do a wonderful job of reducing
 the size of digital video.
 However, during the initial phases of development for a new game, developers
 reasonably would not want any unnecessary factors impinging on the quality
 of their work.
 This enables developers to choose the compression scheme that best suits
 their work when the work is more mature.
 This is another reason we would not want developers doing video-related
 work on remote systems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Wasting Money
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section we look at the cost of a resonably powerful workstation
 suitable for video game development and compare that to the cost of using
 an equivalent machine available from Amazon Web Services.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We are assuming here that our team of developers is working on PC games.
 Cost analysis of console development kits or other video game platforms
 is outside the scope of this essay.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a game development system, it makes sense to use a system for playing
 video games.
 So, we choose a high-end Alienware system from Dell, with a 24 inch monitor.
 The price of this system on Dell.com at the time of this writing is $2,597.99
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-39"

\end_inset

.
 We are considering an international team of developers, so we will add
 another $200.00 for shipping.
 Also, debugging graphical applications often requires a separate monitor
 because user interface actions, such as key presses and mouse clicks a
 developer would need to do to switch to an IDE window while the game is
 active can disrupt the debugging process.
 So, we add a second 24 inch monitor to the list of equipment our developer
 will need.
 Priceline.com lists several at various prices, we will assume purchase of
 a monitor plus shipping will come out to $300.00.
 This gives us an estimated cost of $3,097.99 for the equipment we would
 need to provide to a programmer for his video game development work.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Dell web site lists the following metrics for components that we will
 need for determining which instance to select from AWS to get an eqivalent
 machine: 16 GB random access memory, 2 TB hard drive, 4 core Intel i7 processor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We use 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-41"

\end_inset

 to find a price for the equivalent system.
 The closest equivalent we find is the m3.Xlarge instance.
 The AWS FAQ recommends fixed performance instances for resource intensive
 applications 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-42"

\end_inset

.
 It has 4 vCPU's, 15 GB random access memory, and 80 GB storage.
 This is far less storage than the Dell machine we are considering.
 We could factor in the cost of using S-3 storage to get an equivalent amount
 of storage space for the Amazon m3.Xlarge instance, but we will ignore that
 cost for the purposes of this estimate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amazon prices usage of the instance at $0.28 per hour.
 We will assume that the instance must remain on constantly to accomodate
 developer's inspiration that could occur at any time.
 The cost of leaving the instance running for one year (
\begin_inset Formula $\$0.28\times24\times365$
\end_inset

) is $2,452.80.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Surprisingly, this is very close to the cost of the Dell Alienware Aurora
 - $3,097.99.
 However, we can reasonably amortize the cost of the Aurora over two years.
 Thus, the annual cost for using the Aurora is approximately $1549.0.
 We therefore realize a savings of $903.80 anually if we field the developer
 the Dell Alienware Aurora as opposed to the m3.Xlarge AWS instance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus we have shown that we can field developers high end systems and save
 approximately 30% of the cost of fielding an equivalent virtual machine
 running on a cloud based platform.
