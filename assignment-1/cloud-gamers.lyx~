Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is a feasibility study on the subject of whether or not a cloud computing
 environment would be suitable for an international team of video game developer
s.
 This study fulfills the requirement in Assignment 1, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We are a group of video game developers from several countries.
 Evaluate if it would make sense for us to use cloud computing to build
 games.

\end_inset

.
 In this work we assume Amazon Web Services is our cloud services provider.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For this evauluation we determine the scope of activities that should be
 done in the cloud.
 We consider whether or not it would be appropriate for 
\shape italic
all
\shape default
 activities to be done on a cloud based platform, or some of them.
 Pertinent to this consideration is the cost of activities.
 We use pricing data to bolster our recommendations.
 We discuss which activities could be done in the cloud.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Part*
Scope of Activities in the Cloud
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
One Hundred Percent In the Cloud?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first thought we had for doing this evaluation was that we are proposing
 to have developers write, compile, and exectute code on virtual machines
 on a platform like Amazon Web Services as part of the game development
 process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
This would be unneccessary and wasteful.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
It is not necessary...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is not necessary for developers to do all of their work on virtual machines
 because they have to use some kind of device to access internet based services
 in the first place.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We feel that activities that require high utilization of system resources
 should be carried out on physical machines that are within a few meters
 of the developer.
 This would include compiling source code, running unit tests, and hand
 testing larger units of execution.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Personal experience has shown the writer that these kinds of resource intensive
 tasks are more conveniently performed on systems physically close by, espeicall
y when the need for troubleshooting arises.
 When programming a remote system, there is a temptation to blame network
 latency for poor performance.
 One's ego can blind one to the fact of the inferiority of his creations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since developers have to have some sort of machine to participate in development
 projects, the most resource intensive activities should be done locally.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
It would be wasteful...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two resources that would be wasted: money and bandwidth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Wasting Bandwidth
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We are discussing video game development.
 We point this out to underscore the key word video.
 In general we must allow for the amount of data involved in creating, recording
, transmitting, displaying video to be large.
 This is an inescapble consequence of the fact that a good digital video
 is a series of digital images, a quality digital image is a collection
 of millions of pixels, where we need three bytes of storage for every pixel
 if we want to get a realistic palette of colors.
 If developers are working on video in a way that requires the video to
 be sent from a remote location for every iteration of their work, then
 large amounts of data are getting dowloaded unecessarily due to the data-intens
ive nature of video.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We are aware of compression techniques that do a wonderful job of reducing
 the size of digital video.
 However, during the initial phases of development for a new game, developers
 reasonably would not want any unnecessary factors impinging on the quality
 of their work.
 This enables developers to choose the compression scheme that best suits
 their work when the work is more mature.
 This is another reason we would not want developers doing video-related
 work on remote systems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The bottom line is that sending video over the internet potentially means
 sending large amounts of data over the internet.
 We should avoid sending more video over the network than necessary as a
 way to allocate more of network resources to activities where using the
 network absolutely necessary.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Wasting Money
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section we look at the cost of a resonably powerful workstation
 suitable for video game development and compare that to the cost of using
 an equivalent machine available from Amazon Web Services.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We are assuming here that our team of developers is working on PC games.
 Presently, we are not aware of cloud based offerings of specialized systems
 such as video game console development kits.
 The cloud based virtual machine offerings that we know of are alternatives
 to using PC's.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a game development system, it makes sense to use a system for playing
 video games.
 So, we choose a high-end Alienware system from Dell, with a 24 inch monitor.
 The price of this system on Dell.com at the time of this writing is $2,597.99
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-39"

\end_inset

.
 We are considering an international team of developers, so we will add
 another $200.00 for shipping.
 Also, debugging graphical applications often requires a separate monitor
 because user interface actions, such as key presses and mouse clicks a
 developer would need to do to switch to an IDE window while the game is
 active can disrupt the debugging process.
 So, we add a second 24 inch monitor to the list of equipment our developer
 will need.
 Priceline.com lists several at various prices, we will assume purchase of
 a monitor plus shipping will come out to $300.00.
 This gives us an estimated cost of $3,097.99 for the equipment we would
 need to provide to a programmer for his video game development work.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Dell web site lists the following metrics for components that we will
 need for determining which instance to select from AWS to get an eqivalent
 machine: 16 GB random access memory, 2 TB hard drive, 4 core Intel i7 processor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We use 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-41"

\end_inset

 to find a price for the equivalent system.
 The closest equivalent we find is the m3.Xlarge instance.
 The AWS FAQ recommends fixed performance instances for resource intensive
 applications 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-42"

\end_inset

.
 It has 4 vCPU's, 15 GB random access memory, and 80 GB storage.
 This is far less storage than the Dell machine we are considering.
 We could factor in the cost of using S-3 storage to get an equivalent amount
 of storage space for the Amazon m3.Xlarge instance, but we will ignore that
 cost for the purposes of this estimate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amazon prices usage of the instance at $0.28 per hour.
 We will assume that the instance must remain on constantly to accomodate
 developer's inspiration that could occur at any time.
 The cost of leaving the instance running for one year (
\begin_inset Formula $\$0.28\times24\times365$
\end_inset

) is $2,452.80.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Surprisingly, this is very close to the cost of the Dell Alienware Aurora
 - $3,097.99.
 However, we can reasonably amortize the cost of the Aurora over two years.
 Thus, the annual cost for using the Aurora is approximately $1549.0.
 We therefore realize a savings of $903.80 anually if we field the developer
 the Dell Alienware Aurora as opposed to the m3.Xlarge AWS instance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus we have shown that we can field developers high end systems and save
 approximately 30% of the cost of fielding an equivalent virtual machine
 running on a cloud based platform.
 The virtual machine dedicated to the write, compile, test development cycle
 that is a large part of a developer's work is a waste of money in consideration
 of what we have discussed above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
What We Should Use the Cloud For
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have gone to some lengths to show that relying entirely on the cloud
 is not cost effective in terms of money or bandwidth.
 However there are many use cases where relying on the cloud makes sense.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Getting started
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we are just starting up the international team, we need to use the cloud.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For this use case, we are thinking of using the cloud at the software-as-a-servi
ce (SAAS) level.
 Two example services that come to mind are linkedin.com and odesk.com.
 If we are looking to assemble a team of developers from around the world
 we need to use services like these to locate, interview and select our
 team members.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Linkedin.com is a well known business oriented social networking that claims
 to have over 300 million users
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-44"

\end_inset

.
 Someone looking to assemble a team of programmers can use linkedin to post
 employment opportunities and search for candidates.
 Linkedin.com is only one example of software-as-a-service platforms one
 can take advantage of to assemble a geographically dispersed team of video
 game developers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Odesk.com is a site oriented to connecting freelance software developers
 with customers in need of new software
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-45"

\end_inset

.
 One strategy for assembling a team is to write project specifications in
 a modular fashion and hire developers on medium to long term contracts
 to implement different modules of the specification.
 Services such as the one Odesk.com provides are a convenient way to hire
 developers where the work to be done and cost for the work is negociated
 up-front.
 For some video game development teams and project goals, using a cloud
 service like Odesk.com might be as far as the team leader would need to
 go to assemble a team to accomplish the goals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even if we are planning on a world tour to seek out the greatest programmers
 in all the technology hot-spots we would be remiss in our search if we
 did not include some of the business oriented social networking services
 that are so widely and cheaply available.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Getting together
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the team is already assembled, there are more services we could use at
 the software-as-a-service level for communicating.
 Security and privacy concerns drive what we decide to use for communicating.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
If privacy and security is not a concern:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we do not care who is listening in to our conversations we can use any
 free, software-as-a-service communications applications that are in such
 wonderful abundance in this day and age.
 Examples are Skype
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-46"

\end_inset

, and the Google Hangouts Plugin.
 These are only two among dozens of possible applications one may use to
 communicate far more cheaply than with traditional telephony.
 If the video game project we are working on is a team of volunteers working
 on a free, open source project where privacy and secrecy is not a concern,
 then options abound.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The caveat to using these services is that one must often agree to terms
 of service that stipulate that the service provider is allowed to collect
 data one stores in their cloud for further use.
 The Google Privacy Policy states, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We provide personal information to our affiliates or other trusted businesses
 or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance
 with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security
 measures.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-48"

\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 So, not only is Google admitting they will collect data from its users,
 but also they are stating that they provide it to third parties.
 Suffice it to say, popular free-to-use, software-as-a-service communciations
 applications are not private, and are probably not the best choice for
 exchanging information like trade secrets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Secure Communications in the Cloud
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One might be tempted to make the assumption that a paid, cloud based communicati
ons service would be secure.
 We did some research into providers to find an example of a paid, video
 conferencing service, 1Click.io.
 This is from their privacy policy, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
